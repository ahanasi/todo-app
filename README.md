[Live Preview](https://ahanasi.github.io/todo-app/)

A simple todo-list app.
Users will be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into. Todos can also be prioritized or assigned a due-date.

This site was created with Webpack and ES6 Modules. The DOM elements of the website were created using Javascript alone, while SASS was used for styling.
